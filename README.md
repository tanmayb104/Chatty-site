#### A Microsoft Teams Clone built for Microsoft Engage 2021 ####

<br>

The Challenge
------------

Build a Microsoft Teams clone.

The solution should be a fully functional prototype with at least one mandatory functionality - a minimum of two participants should be able connect with each other using the product to have a video conversation.


What I Accomplished
-------------------

I successfully implemented the video calling feature. More than two people can currently video call together using the web site. I also implemented:

1. Login/SignUp
2. Ability to update profile, reset password and forgot password.
3. Join different rooms
4. Create your own room
5. Chat functionality in a room
6. Message are saved to database
7. Videocall with participants in a room
8. Switch audio on/off
9. Switch video on/off
10. Chatbox in the Videocall
11. Made the site fully responsive

The current chat in the meeting does not save the messages because for messages involving the whole room can be sent in the room chat itself. The meeting chat gets disolved after the meet has ended.


Technologies Used 
-----------------


1. Django
2. HTML 
3. CSS 
4. Bootstrap
5. JavaScript
6. WebRTC


What I Learned
--------------------------------

Microsoft and the Acehacker team kept various sessions for us to learn more about the work culture at Microsoft. We also learned about new technologies that have been developed by Microsoft (ie Azure Communication Services) and about the Agile Methodology. 

The <strong>Agile Scrum Methodology</strong> has heavily influenced my work in the past 1 month. 
Agile scrum methodology is a project management system that relies on incremental development. Each iteration consists of two- to four-week sprints, where each sprint's goal is to build the most important features first and come out with a potentially deliverable product. <br>
Microsoft assigned us three sprints of 1-2 weeks each: <strong>Design, Build, and Adopt.</strong><br><br>
In the <strong>first two weeks</strong>, I researched on WebRTC, Agora and Jitsi to decide on which SDK I wanted to use for my web app. Ended up deciding on WebRTC. Got working on establishing video communication between connections. <br><br>
In the <strong>third and fourth week</strong>, I worked on adding additional features to my web app. <br><br>
In the <strong>last week</strong>, I worked on hosting the site on heroku along with aws for serving the static as well as media files and worked on the UI for the whole web site.<br><br>



Future Possible Functionalities
-------------------------------

1. Add notification feature
2. Improve upon the Adapt functionality in the web app
3. Improve the UI of the site 
4. Reduce delay and latency
5. Increase Scalability 
6. Add dark mode
7. Add pagination to the chat
